Practical DC converters are not ideal because they include many **sources of power loss**, such as inductor copper and core loss, and voltage drops across semiconductor devices.
This is how to model one of this power loss.
- Inductor copper loss can be modeled by adding a series resistance to the inductor.
- MOSFETs and BJTs can be modeled with an on-resistance.
- Diodes, IGBTs, and thyristors can be modeled with an on-resistance and a voltage source.

 **When the ripple in a DC converter circuit is small**, the converter can be approximated as an ideal DC transformer. The DC transformer model is time-invariant and therefore
contains only the DC component. The DC transformer model can be used to calculate **the DC component of the real circuit and the power** absorbed or supplied by elements, even though the currents are represented
by their average values. This is because the difference between $I_{\text{rms}}^2 R$ and $I_{\text{avg}}^2 R$ is very small (for example, only about 0.33% for a 10% ripple).

<br><br>How to Approximate a DC Converter as a DC Transformer Circuit
1.	Derive the corresponding mesh and node equations from the volt-second balance and the charge balance, respectively.
2.	Use the small-ripple approximation to calculate $\langle i_g \rangle$, and represent the source as a voltage source $V_g$ with current $I_g$.
3.	Combine the circuits obtained from steps 1 and 2.
4.	Replace the dependent sources with an equivalent DC transformer.
